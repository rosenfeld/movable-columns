# Movable-Columns usage

This is a simple jQuery plugin for moving/reordering table columns.

JavaScript:

    $('table').movableColumns()

The _click_ event still works so that you can use this with a sortable plugin, for instance.

Css:

    .movable-columns-hover { background-color: lightyellow }

The table is a regular one. The _th_ elements from the first row will be draggable/droppables.

Take a look at index.html in the _example_ branch for an example or take a look at
[this jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/CTADm/1).
